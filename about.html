        <p class="biggy"> <u>We want to help</u></p>
        <p class="reg">Currently, cancer, is a big problem... </p> 
        <ul><li>Cancer is currently the leading cause of death in the world</li><li>Two out of every five people are diagnosed with cancer</li><li>Every year, millions of people die from cancer</li></ul>
<p class="reg">
Many people hear these statistics get scared, or feel bad, but that isn't enough. We can't sit on the sidelines, here at Artists Against Cancer, 
<span class="blue">we are determined to help.</span> 
We will not stand back and watch. We fight cancer and take it head on. We fight what destroys by creating. We fight cancer with art. Every dollar spent on art, is immediately donated to charity. Please help us, to help that two out of every six people.
