                          <p class="reg">What if <u>we</u> could help? It was a difficult thing to ask of ourselves,
after all, we were so <small>small</small> and cancer was so <big>big.</big> But we realized that working together we were much <span class="blue">stronger</span> than cancer would ever be. 
<span class="blue">But HOW?</span>
How to stop cancer? I know, tough question. But we realized something; if cancer is something made of destruction, we should fight it with it's polar opposite, construction, imagination, and of course ART. That's why we founded Artists Against Cancer. We make and sell art to regular folks like you, where <span class="blue">100%</span> of the money goes to cancer research, that way, you too can make a difference. We hope you'll join us in our fight, to stop cancer with our ultimate weapon, art.</p>
